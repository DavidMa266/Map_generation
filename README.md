# Map_generation

Map/terrain Generation experimentation and fun. 
Starting off with stuff like Perlin Noise and Fortune's line sweep algorithm to produce Voronoi polygons for interesting terrain.
Following http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/ as the holy text

Perlin Noise + Gradient Mask on 2D arrays seems to make pretty decent islands. 

Trying to implement Voronoi polygons.
